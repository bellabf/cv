# About me 
I am a biologist who fell in love with data science and statistics.My main interests are in algorithm and machine learning development, interpretable artificial intelligence, and computer vision. I am a big fan of communicating results more clearly and concisely through using data visualization, open science and reproducible reporting.

# Education
### 2020-2022: Master's Degree in Bioinformatics - Computational and Mathematical Biology, earned from the University of Aix-Marseille, Sciences Luminy, France.

This interdisciplinary program combined courses in computer science, mathematics, and biology, with a focus on analyzing data that are complex.
I gained a good foundation in linear algebra, discrete and continuous dynamical systems, graph theory, and network analysis, as well as expertise in statistical analysis of big data, advanced statistics, and analysis of OMIC data

### 2016-2019 : BAC+4 ou 5. Biological Sciences. Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences with a broad range of coursework in different biological ares (i.e. ecology, evolution, molecular biology, biochemistry, etc).

Additionally, I completed over 400 hours of supplemental coursework in statistics and computer science, allowing me to develop strong skills in data analysis and computational techniques.

For my undergraduate thesis, I conducted research on microRNA expression in carcinomas, using data mining techniques to identify patterns of co-expression. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of data analysis and computational tools to real-world questions.
