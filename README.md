# About me 

As a biologist turned data enthusiast, I am passionate about harnessing the power of statistics and data science to uncover insights and drive impactful change. My interests lie in developing cutting-edge algorithms and machine learning models, particularly in the areas of interpretable artificial intelligence and computer vision.

I strongly believe in the importance of clear and concise communication and love using data visualization, open science, and reproducible reporting to share my findings with others. Let's connect and chat about data science and machine learning! Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter, LinkedIn, or through my Substack newsletter.

# Education

### 2023-now: PhD - University of Aix-Marseille, France.

Joint PhD training between Centre of Immunology of Marseille (CIML) and Informatics and Systems Laboratory (LIS UMR 7020). My work is focused on developing scientific software for image analysis using a variety of technices including image preprocessing, computer vision, and machine learning tools to unravel the effects of the neurvous system in lymph node development.

### 2020-2022: Master's Degree in Bioinformatics - Computational and Mathematical Biology, earned from the University of Aix-Marseille, Sciences Luminy, France.

This interdisciplinary program combined courses in computer science, mathematics, and biology, with a focus on analyzing data that are complex.

I gained a good foundation in linear algebra, discrete and continuous dynamical systems, graph theory, and network analysis, as well as expertise in statistical analysis of big data, advanced statistics, and analysis of OMIC data

### 2016-2019 : BAC+4 ou 5. Biological Sciences. Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences with a broad range of coursework in different biological ares (i.e. ecology, evolution, molecular biology, biochemistry, etc).

Additionally, I completed over 400 hours of supplemental coursework in statistics and computer science, allowing me to develop strong skills in data analysis and computational techniques.

For my undergraduate thesis, I conducted research on microRNA expression in carcinomas, using data mining techniques to identify patterns of co-expression. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of data analysis and computational tools to real-world questions.

# Experience

#### 2022-2022. Marseille, France - Internship as **Bio-image data analyst** at Laboratoire d'Informatique & Systèmes on Guignard's lab under Léo Guignard's supervision, Université D'Aix-Marseille.
 - **Description**: In this project, I contributed to the development of techniques for 3D imaging processing to accurately segment and align whole 3D objects. The objective was to improve the efficiency of analysis by optimizing segmentation and alignment methods.
 - **Keywords**: Image Processing; Image segmentation; Image registration; 3D imaging; Developmental biology.

#### 2021. Marseille, France - Internship as **Data scientist** at **INRIA** on COMPO's team under Sebastien Benzekry's supervision (9 weeks).
  - **Description**: : In this project, I developed multiple machine learning models to predict the response of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients to immune-checkpoint inhibition. The models were built using tidymodels and clinical data containing blood count and hematological markers. I also developed an API for the model development.
  -  **Keywords**: Machine learning development; Tidymodels; Prediction of immunotherapy response; Clinical data; API development.

#### 2019. Campo Grande, Brazil - **Bioinformatician** at  **EMBRAPA - Gado de Corte** (5 months).
  - **Description**: : I was part of a bioinformatics project aimed at addressing the in-house demand for RNA-seq and SNP analysis. I used R and Galaxy to perform data analysis and down-stream analysis of protein-protein interaction networks. Additionally, I utilized Cytoscape to visualize and interpret the resulting protein-protein interaction network.
  - **Keywords**: RNA-seq; SNPs analysis; R; Galaxy; Protein-protein interaction network; Cytoscape.

#### 2016-2018. Campo Grande, Brazil - **Undergraduate Researcher** at **INFI- UFMS** (2 years).

 - **Description**: I used molecular dynamics simulations with pH and redox potential changes to investigate the conformational changes of Interleucine-8 and Cytochrome C. The project was carried out using the powerful AMBER software package and involved complex Bash scripting, protein alignment, and molecular dynamics simulations.
 - **Keywords**: Molecular Dynamics Simulations; AMBER; Protein alignment; Bash scripting.
