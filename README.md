# About me 

Hi, I am a data enthusiast with 2 years of experience. I'm a problem solver at heart, and I'm not afraid to dive into the worlds of both artificial intelligence and classical statistics. My mission is to discover the information that lies hidden within data and to turn that into biteable stories to drive change.

# Experience

#### Researcher in Computer Vision | Aix-Marseille University
- Led research projects in the field of Computer Vision, focusing on the application of machine learning techniques to analyze complex datasets.
- Developed and fine-tuned custom algorithms for 3D image object detection.
- Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders

#### Image Data Analyst | CENTURI - Turing Centre for Living Systems · Internship

- Developed 3D image processing techniques (Image Processing, Image Segmentation, Image registration)
- Proposed a lossless data format change that reduced memory storage by 35%, resulting in a savings of 70 gigabytes (70GB).
- Presented findings through interactive reporting for effective communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

#### Data Scientist | Inria · Internship

- Designed and deployed diverse machine learning models (Machine Learning, Tidymodels) to predict patient responses to immunotherapy, utilizing clinical data.
- Translated technical insights into a practical solution by developing and integrating predictive models into an API (API Development).
- Used Version Control (Git, GitHub, GitLab) to manage the codebase and enable efficient collaboration.


#### Bioinformatician | Embrapa · Internship
- Conducted in-house RNA-seq and SNP analyses, utilizing R and Galaxy (Bioinformatics Tools) to derive actionable insights from data.
