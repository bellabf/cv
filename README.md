# About me

I fell in love with data science and statistics while studying for my undergraduate degree in Biological Science. I have, since then, completely turned to data analysis. I believe in harvesting the power of machine learning to solve problems (and luckily, biology is full of them!). **I am interested applying ML in personalized healthcare, oncology, imaging, biomarkers, and algorithm development** . I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in bioinformatics (focused on computational and mathematical biology), and I am actively looking for an M2 internship. 


# Technical Skills

  - Programming (R, python, java)
  - Machine learning
  - Rmarkdown and jupyter notebooks
  - Tidy tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, tidymodels)
  - Version control (git, github, gitlab)
  - Storytelling and data Visualisation
  - SQL
  - Bash, unix, and familiary with command line
  - Galaxy  

# Education

### 2020-2022 : Bac+5. Master Bio-informatique parcours Computational and Mathematical Biology. Université d’Aix-Marseille, Marseille, France.
Interdisciplinary degree with courses in Computer Science, Mathematics and Biology. Topics included linear algebra, discrete and continuous dynamical systems, graph theory, network analysis, statistical analysis of big data, advanced statistics, and analysis of OMIC data.

### 2016-2019 : BAC+4 ou 5. Sciences Biologiques. Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
General biological sciences degree with classes in ecology, evolution, molecular biology, chemistry and zoology, and botany. I also took over 400 hours in supplemental classes in statistics and computer science (major and minor system does not apply).
